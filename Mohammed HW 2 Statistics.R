#PP1:
  
  #Our first roll was a 5, this means that the dice is fair because it did not roll a 6.
  #The probability that it will judged to be unfair is 5/6 or 83.3 percent if it is fair dice.
  #If it was unfair, the probability will be that it depends based on how one makes it unfair.
  
  PP2:
  
  #Our trial -> pp2 <- c(6,2,5,4,2,2,2,5,5,4,4,2,4,3,1,6,6,3,3,1)
#We tried stimulating and we did it manually as well, in both cases we rolled 6 three times
#When we stimulated the roll of the dice 20 times, we got 6 three times
#Our decision rule is that it is fair if 6 is rolled three times or less 
#and unfair if 6 is rolled four times or more.
#If dice is rolled 20 times, likely number 6 results is  (1/6) * 20 =  3.33
#If the dice is 20 times and the dice is fair, the probability that is unfair is 43.3 percent 
#becaue P(X >= 4) = 0.433


  

#PP3


#We tried the stimulation many times and did not got any thing more than 24
#Our decision rule is that, if the dice is rolled 25 times or higher it is unfair, if the dice is rolled 24 times or less it is fair.
#When we stimulated the roll of the 100 ties, we got 6 12 times
#Since 12 < 24, we can say the dice is fair
#If the dice is rolled 100 times, likely number of 6 result is (1/6) * 100 = 16.67
#If the dice is fair, The probability that the dice would be unfair is 2.17 percent 
#because P(x >= 25) = 0.0217

#EP1:
#From our class trial, we rolled manually and not manually got six 20 times combining the manual and non manual
#Together the trial comes to 160 trials
# Decision Rule: 6 is rolled 32 or more it is unfair 
#Since six is rolled 20 times it is fair
#I would add more trials and see how the probability changes
